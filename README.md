# Digital Circuit Simulator

This program simulates a digital circuit based on input from three files: a library file, a circuit file, and a stimulus file. 

## Files

- `main.cpp`: This is the main file where the simulation is run.
- `Gates.h`: This file contains the `Gates` class which represents a type of gate used in the circuit.
- `Outputs.h`: This file contains the `Outputs` class which represents an output in the circuit.
- `component.h`: This file contains the `component` class which represents a component in the circuit.
- `Postfix_Functions.h`: This file contains functions for converting infix expressions to postfix and evaluating postfix expressions.
- `readInput_Functions.h`: This file contains functions for reading the library, circuit, and stimulus files.
- `Input.h`: This file contains the `Input` class which represents an input to the circuit.
